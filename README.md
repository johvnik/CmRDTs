A collection of Commutative Replicated Data Types (CmRDTs) implemented in pure Rust.

This library provides a set of simple, serializable, and composable CRDTs suitable for distributed systems and local-first applications.

---
## Implemented CRDTs

- **`GCounter`**: A Grow-Only Counter.
- **`PNCounter`**: A Positive-Negative Counter.

---
## Testing üß™

This library is tested using a combination of:

- **Unit tests** for core logic within each module.
- **Property-based tests** with `proptest` to rigorously verify that the CRDTs adhere to their mathematical properties (commutativity, associativity, idempotence) across a wide range of randomized scenarios.

---
## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

The near-term goals for this library are:

- [ ] Implement `LWWRegister` (Last-Write-Wins Register).
- [ ] Implement `GSet` (Grow-Only Set).
- [ ] Implement `OrSet` (Observed-Remove Set).
- [ ] Implement `RGA` (Replicable Growable Array).
